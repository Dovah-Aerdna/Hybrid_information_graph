# Hybrid information on graph

Some tools for simulation of hybrid (quantum and classical) information evolution on graph (such as consensus networks) are developed.

- hybrid_information.ipynb : jupyter notebook containing python code developing the simulation;
- hybrid_information.py : the same content of hybrid_information.ipynb as a python script;
- graph_density.nb : a Mathematica notebook for controlling the density of generated random graphs.
